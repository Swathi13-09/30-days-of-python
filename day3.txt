🔢 What is a Variable in Python?
A variable is a named container used to store data in a program.
It acts like a label attached to a value so you can use or modify that value later.

✅ Syntax:

variable_name = value

💡 Example:

name = "Swathi"
age = 21
name is storing a string, and age is storing an integer.

🧬 What are Data Types in Python?
A data type tells Python what kind of value is being stored in a variable — like a number, text, list, etc.

Python is dynamically typed, so you don’t need to declare the data type explicitly. Python figures it out automatically.

🧠 Common Data Types in Python

| Data Type | Description                    | Example                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `int`     | Integer (whole numbers)        | `age = 25`                                |
| `float`   | Decimal numbers                | `height = 5.6`                            |
| `str`     | String (text)                  | `name = "Swathi"`                         |
| `bool`    | Boolean (True/False)           | `is_student = True`                       |
| `list`    | Collection of values (ordered) | `fruits = ["apple", "mango"]`             |
| `tuple`   | Ordered, immutable collection  | `coordinates = (10, 20)`                  |
| `dict`    | Key-value pairs                | `profile = {"name": "Swathi", "age": 21}` |
| `set`     | Unordered, unique values       | `colors = {"red", "blue"}`                |

🔧 Why Variables and Data Types are Important

| 🔍 Purpose                        | ✅ Use in Code/Real-world Example   |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Store user input                  | `username = input("Enter name: ")` |
| Perform calculations              | `total = price * quantity`         |
| Make decisions (with `if`/`else`) | `if is_member: apply_discount()`   |
| Handle large data (lists/dicts)   | `students = ["A", "B", "C"]`       |
| Build dynamic systems             | APIs, dashboards, chatbots, etc.   |

🎯 Summary

Variables: Used to label and store data.

Data Types: Define the nature of data.

Python is dynamically typed, so you can change a variable’s value or type easily.

Used everywhere: calculations, forms, data handling, projects, and more.

REAL TIME APPLICATION

2. 🧑‍💻 User Profile Management in Web Apps
Use:

Store user data, preferences, login status

username = "swathi123"
is_logged_in = True
followers = 1050
bio = "Tech enthusiast and Python learner"

🔐 Used in websites like Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.
