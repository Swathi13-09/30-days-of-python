🎯 Objective:

Build a program that takes multiple employees' attendance & work hours, then:

Calculates daily wages

Applies salary deductions for less work hours

Tracks absentees

Generates a summary report

💻 Tech Covered:

if, elif, else

for & while loops

break, continue

Nested structures


PROGRAM


print("🏢 Welcome to HR Attendance & Salary System\n")

num_employees = int(input("Enter number of employees to process: "))
hourly_rate = 100  # ₹100 per hour

absentees = []
total_paid = 0

for i in range(num_employees):
    name = input(f"\n👤 Enter employee {i+1} name: ")
    present = input("🟢 Present today? (yes/no): ").lower()

    if present == "no":
        print(f"❌ {name} is marked absent.")
        absentees.append(name)
        continue  # skip rest and go to next employee

    hours_worked = float(input("⏱️ Enter hours worked today: "))

    if hours_worked < 4:
        print(f"⚠️ {name} worked less than half-day. No salary paid.")
        continue

    if 4 <= hours_worked < 8:
        salary = hourly_rate * hours_worked * 0.8  # 20% deduction
        print(f"💰 {name}'s partial salary with deduction: ₹{salary:.2f}")
    else:
        salary = hourly_rate * hours_worked
        print(f"✅ {name}'s full salary: ₹{salary:.2f}")

    total_paid += salary

# Final Report
print("\n📊 --- Daily HR Report --- 📊")
print(f"Total Employees Processed: {num_employees}")
print(f"Total Absentees: {len(absentees)} - {', '.join(absentees)}")
print(f"Total Salary Paid Today: ₹{total_paid:.2f}")
